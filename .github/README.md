# AI Personal Trainer

Use the Strava API to get a user's exercise history. The simulated trainer can suggest stretching routines, diets & training regimens based on the user's history.

## Tech Stack

1. I'm using [Gadget](https://gadget.dev/) for the front end and back end of this app.
2. I'll handle authentication via the user's Strava account. Once the user is logged in, user's exercise history will be queried via the [Strava API](https://developers.strava.com/).
3. Finally, [Braintrust](https://www.braintrust.dev/) is used to test the models. I'll choose a base model based on the Braintrust tests.
